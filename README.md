# SPT Realism Ammo Graph

This web application visualizes ammunition data for the SPT Realism Mod, displaying damage and penetration values for different calibers in a scatter plot. Users can select various calibers to compare their performance. The chart dynamically adjusts its axes and includes class labels for penetration levels.


## Usage

Visit [https://acksberg.github.io/SPTRealismAmmoGraph/](https://acksberg.github.io/SPTRealismAmmoGraph/) or download the `index.html`, `script.js`, and `data\data.js`.

After downloading, open the `index.html`.

The rest of the files are examples or are used to create the `data.js`.

## Files

- **get_live_data.py**: A Python script that grabs the latest ammo stats from `tarkov.dev` and puts them into the `live_data.json` file. The script needs the Python module `requests`, which can be installed via `pip install requests`.
- **live_data.json**: A JSON file that contains the current live Tarkov ammo stats, generated by the `get_live_data.py` script.
- **get_spt_data.py**: A Python script that lets you import the `items.json` and `en.json` (or any other language file) from your current SPT-AKI build to process the ammo stats and save them into the `spt_data.json` file.
    - The `items.json` file is located in `\SPT_Data\Server\database\templates\` if you want to update the `data.js` file yourself.
    - The `en.json` file is located in `\SPT_Data\Server\database\locales\global\` if you want to update the `data.js` file yourself.
- **en.json**: A JSON file that contains all the names used in the game for specific IDs, used here to get the correct names of the ammo.
- **items.json**: A JSON file that contains all items present in the game.
- **spt_data.json**: A JSON file that contains the imported SPT-AKI ammo stats, generated by the `get_spt_data.py` script.
- **caliber_data.json**: A JSON file that contains the currently available ammo for each caliber (currently not used but useful for maintenance).
- **caliber_and_types.py**: A script needed by the other Python scripts; here you can change how the different calibers are displayed and which ammo to blacklist via ID.
- **ammo_reader.py**: A Python script to read and process ammunition data from the realism mod `ammo.js` file and generate the `data.js` file (note: be aware of the paths in lines 12-14).
    - The `ammo.js` file is located in `\user\mods\SPT-Realism\src\ballistics\ammo.js` if you want to update the `data.js` file yourself.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the web page, including the canvas for the chart and buttons for selecting calibers.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles data processing, chart rendering, and user interactions.
- **data.js**: A JavaScript file containing the ammunition data used by the web application, currently for SPT 3.9.8 and RM 1.4.5.
