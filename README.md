# SPT Realism Ammo Graph
This web application visualizes ammunition data for the SPT Realism Mod, displaying damage and penetration values for different calibers in a scatter plot. Users can select various calibers to compare their performance. The chart dynamically adjusts its axes and includes class labels for penetration levels.
